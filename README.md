<h1>Overview</h1>
With families spread across countries, grandparents don't get to see their grandkids' artwork stuck to the fridge. Through this app, we created a digital experience where parents could help their kids upload their artwork to our app. Grandparents could buy the artworks, rewarding kids' creativity, and place it on their digital fridge.

<h1>Future Plans</h3>
Make these artworks real stickers/magnets that we can ship to grandparents. Grandparents can pay for these. This will also reward kids' creativity and give them an allowance. 

<h1>Technologies</h1>
React + Typescript + Nodejs
